# DSA-With-C-
Data Structures and Algorithms in C++
Overview

This repository documents my structured learning journey of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++.
The goal is to build strong problem-solving skills, improve coding efficiency, and prepare for technical interviews and competitive programming.

Objectives

Master core DSA concepts using C++

Improve logical thinking and problem-solving ability

Practice problems regularly

Prepare for coding interviews and competitive exams (GATE, placements, etc.)

Tech Stack

Language: C++

Compiler: GCC / G++

IDE: VS Code (recommended)

Platform: Linux / Windows
